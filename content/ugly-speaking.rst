It can be miserable reading blog posts about software.

I just skip-read `this post about Python 3
<http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode>`_ by Armin
Ronacher.  I skip-read it because I found it so ugly.

There was a BBC sitcom called `One foot in the grave
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Foot_in_the_Grave>`_.  It had a character
called Victor Meldrew who was always angry.  His catchphrase was an enraged `I
can't believe it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLNrLI3OBwg>`_.

For some reason, this genre seems to be a standard for blog posts.  The author
just can't *believe* that X (a language or operating system) could be so
*stupid* as to do Y.

It is a little puzzling, because I guess most people reading someone saying
how stupid they are, do not say "ah yes, thank you" but "f#@& you asshole".
So, if we do write in that style, we make it less likely the problem will be
fixed.  I suppose that's obvious to the person writing, so there must be some
other thing that is attractive about labeling the other person / system / idea
as a loser.

We technical types don't like to think about soft issues like tone.  Like the
`drunk under the lamp-post <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect>`_
we prefer technical problems, and ignore other important problems such as the
way we are making our readers feel.

When I am reading a blog post of the "I can't believe it" type, I feel like
someone with bad breath is shouting in my face, and my first and strong
reaction is to move away and avoid that person whenever I see them.  For
example, I suppose I won't click on a link to blog post by Armin Ronacher
again, because I predict it will make me feel bad.  I am sure that is a shame
for me, because I have every reason to think Mr Ronacher is competent,
intelligent and well-informed.  It is just I don't want to feel that way.  I
find it harder to work when I feel that way.  I am less gentle with my friends
when I feel that way.

I think what I am saying is, please, please, don't shout in my face, there is
no need for that, and it only makes things worse.
