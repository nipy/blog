Summary: Blog moved from blogspot

The Nipy World blog used to be on Blogspot at <http://nipyworld.blogspot.com>.
I'm restarting the blog here because it's easier and more fun to write the blog
using [Pelican](http://getpelican.com).  I hope that it will be easier for
my fellow NIPistas to add their own posts using Github.
