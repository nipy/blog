Summary: Sofware engineering became a separate discipline and orphaned expertise in scientific programming

I just came across this article: "A Software Chasm: Software Engineering and
Scientific Computing" by Diane Kelley [^kelly].

[^kelly]: Kelly, Diane F. "A software chasm: Software engineering and
    scientific computing." Software, IEEE 24.6 (2007): 120-119.

Diane Kelley is reflecting on the disconnection between the science of software
engineering, and the software engineering of scientists.  Here is the key passage:

>Creating the chasm
>
>In a 1997 paper, Iris Vessey described a shift in computing philosophy that
>occurred in the late 1960s. She quoted George E. Forsyth, the ACM's president
>at that time, as stating that computer science was a field of its own,
>separate from the application domains. The result, as Vessey points out, was
>the insistence that anyone who wanted to be taken seriously in the field of
>computing, and software engineering, must develop domain-independent
>techniques, methods, and paradigms. The pressure was such that claims of
>broad applicability became commonplace. So, the bridge between software
>engineering and any application domain became a single massive structure that
>everyone had to use.

This is the relevant quote from Vessey (1997)[^vessey]:

>Then followed a debate, which endured for over a decade, that pitted
>academia against the computing profession. The notions of traditional
>computer scientists steeped in the notion of theory and the stigma of all
>things "applied" led to the following statement by George E. Forsyth,
>President of ACM, in 1965: "... the core of computer science has become
>and will remain a field of its own, ahead of, and separate from the
>application domain specialists." This philosophy led, not only to the
>creation of generic "solutions" to problems, but also to claims that any
>"creation" was applicable in all situations, because to state otherwise
>would have branded the creator as lacking in academic respectability.

I have noticed that some older scientists appear to believe that writing
software is not the same thing as doing science.  It has always been
mysterious to me how they could have this idea, because it was so obvious to
my own experience that this was not so.  I wonder whether they might have come
under the unconscious influence of the movement that Kelley and Vessey are
describing.  It is easy to see how that tempting that would be; imagine how
easy life would be if all our software problems could be solved by hiring a
"programmer"?

    domain in software." Papers presented at the seventh workshop on Empirical
    studies of programmers. ACM, 1997.
