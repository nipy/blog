</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It can be miserable reading blog posts about software.</p>
<p>I just skip-read <a class="reference external" href="http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2014/5/12/everything-about-unicode">this post about Python 3</a> by Armin
Ronacher.  I skip-read it because I found it so ugly.</p>
<p>There was a BBC sitcom called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Foot_in_the_Grave">One foot in the grave</a>.  It had a character
called Victor Meldrew who was always angry.  His catchphrase was an enraged <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLNrLI3OBwg">I
can't believe it</a>.</p>
<p>For some reason, this genre seems to be a standard for blog posts.  The author
just can't <em>believe</em> that X (a language or operating system) could be so
<em>stupid</em> as to do Y.</p>
<p>It is a little puzzling, because I guess most people reading someone saying
how stupid they are, do not say &quot;ah yes, thank you&quot; but &quot;f#&#64;&amp; you asshole&quot;.
So, if we do write in that style, we make it less likely the problem will be
fixed.  I suppose that's obvious to the person writing, so there must be some
other thing that is attractive about labeling the other person / system / idea
as a loser.</p>
<p>We technical types don't like to think about soft issues like tone.  Like the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect">drunk under the lamp-post</a>
we prefer technical problems, and ignore other important problems such as the
way we are making our readers feel.</p>
<p>When I am reading a blog post of the &quot;I can't believe it&quot; type, I feel like
someone with bad breath is shouting in my face, and my first and strong
reaction is to move away and avoid that person whenever I see them.  For
example, I suppose I won't click on a link to blog post by Armin Ronacher
again, because I predict it will make me feel bad.  I am sure that is a shame
for me, because I have every reason to think Mr Ronacher is competent,
intelligent and well-informed.  It is just I don't want to feel that way.  I
find it harder to work when I feel that way.  I am less gentle with my friends
when I feel that way.</p>
<p>I think what I am saying is, please, please, don't shout in my face, there is
no need for that, and it only makes things worse.</p>
